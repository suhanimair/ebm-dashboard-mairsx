# Success Criteria Definition
# Define specific, measurable criteria to evaluate solution effectiveness

## SMART Success Criteria

**Criterion 1: Primary Outcome**

**Specific:** Measure the frequency of project delays, mistakes, complaints, employee satisfaction with communication, and the number of 
  cross-departmental miscommunication incidents.
**Measurable:** 
1. Reduce communication-related project delays by 10%.
2. Increase employee satisfaction with communication by 15% (via surveys).
3. Track a reduction in reported miscommunication incidents in HR/project management systems.
**Achievable:** Yes, with targeted training, standardized tools, and leadership support, these goals are realistic within existing resources.
**Relevant:** Yes, stronger communication directly addresses the core problem of inefficiency and frustration, improving collaboration and aligning 
with organizational goals.
**Time-bound:** Within 6–12 months of program rollout, progress will be measured, with quarterly check-ins to monitor improvements.

## Measurement Framework

**Quantitative Metrics**

- Number of Complaints: Reduce internal communication-related complaints by 30% within 12 months (tracked through HR logs, helpdesk tickets, or 
  complaints to one another or during meetings)
- Time savings: Achieve an average 15% reduction in time spent clarifying/re-explaining tasks (measured via project management tool data or employee 
  time surveys).
- Quality improvement: Improve project/task accuracy and reduce rework errors by 20% (tracked through QA reports or manager feedback).
- Customer satisfaction: Increase customer satisfaction ratings related to clarity/reliability of service to at least 90% positive on post-service 
  surveys.
- Employee engagement: Raise employee engagement survey scores on communication-related questions by 15% compared to the previous year.

**Qualitative Indicators**
1. Employees report less frustration and greater clarity in day-to-day tasks.
2. Teams demonstrate more collaboration and willingness to share information across departments.
3. Managers observe fewer conflicts or misunderstandings during meetings and project handoffs.


## Risk Indicators
Metrics suggesting the solution is failing would include persistent or increasing project delays, frequent errors because of miscommunication, 
and increasing complaints. Red flags to monitor include teams bypassing new communication tools, low participation from employees, and 
repeated misunderstandings in cross-departmental projects. Mitigation triggers would be any  negative trends in these metrics for more than 
one quarter, indicating that the company wide trainings are not working and needs adjustment. The solution’s effectiveness should be assessed 
continuously, with a formal evaluation at the end of every month until the 12th month to determine whether communication improvements have been 
realized or if additional interventions are required.

## Reporting Framework
Progress will be communicated to stakeholders through a combination of visual dashboards, periodic reports, and structured meetings. Senior management 
will receive executive summaries highlighting key trends, successes, and areas needing attention, while employees and teams will get regular updates on 
improvements, tips for effective communication, and recognition of progress. Customers and suppliers may be informed of changes indirectly through 
service updates or improved responsiveness. Communication will be transparent, consistent, and tailored to each stakeholder group to ensure 
accountability and engagement throughout the intervention. Regular reports will consist of number of delays, issues, mistakes, and complaints
Formal assesments will occur at the end of each month for 12 months but check-ins will occur every two weeks. Formal assessments will include surveys, 
feedback forms, observations, reports to managers. Check ins will consist of emails being sent out asking for any concerns or questions after a 
training program and estalbishing a common ground department wide.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Be specific and measurable - avoid vague terms like "better" or "improved"
2. Ensure criteria are achievable given your resources and timeline
3. Include both quantitative and qualitative measures
4. Consider different stakeholder perspectives on success
5. Plan how you'll actually collect the measurement data

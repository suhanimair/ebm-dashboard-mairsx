# Success Criteria Definition
# Define specific, measurable criteria to evaluate solution effectiveness

## SMART Success Criteria

**Criterion 1: Primary Outcome**

**Specific:** Measure the frequency of project delays, mistakes, complaints employee satisfaction with communication, and the number of cross 
departmental miscommunication incidents.
**Measurable:** 
1. Reduce communication-related project delays by 10%.
2. Increase employee satisfaction with communication by 15% (via surveys).
3. Track a reduction in reported miscommunication incidents in HR/project management systems.
**Achievable:** Yes, with targeted training, standardized tools, and leadership support, these goals are realistic within existing resources.
**Relevant:** Yes, stronger communication directly addresses the core problem of inefficiency and frustration, improving collaboration and aligning 
with organizational goals.
**Time-bound:** Within 6â€“12 months of program rollout, progress will be measured, with quarterly check-ins to monitor improvements.

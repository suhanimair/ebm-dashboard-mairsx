**Problem Definition Framework:**
Within an organization, there are multiple departments with different teams. The problem is how do we improve communication 
and manage the different communication styles within an organization. Communication is essential for an organization to run smoothly, 
and is often the most frustrating part when working with people. 
 

**What outcome do we want to achieve?:**
Improve communication with different teams in a department to 
reduce frustration and improve efficiency. 

**PICOC Framework:**

**Population (P - Who is affected by this problem?):**
Employees within different departments. The main focus are estalbishing better communication through cross-functional teams in a department. 

**Intervention (I - What solution/action are we considering?)**
Introduce and focus on a department-wide communication improvement program that includes:
     • Training workshops on effective communication and active listening
     • Establish common ground through the use of standardized communication tools (ex: Slack, Teams, project management platforms) to reduce 
       misalignment
     • Establishing communication norms across departments (ex: frequency of updates, clear expectations on response times, preferred communication 
       channels)
     • Encouraging team building exercises to develop a mutual understanding of communication styles across coworkers

**Comparison (C - What alternatives exist?)**
    • Do nothing: Allow teams to continue using their own informal communication methods.
    • Team-specific training: Each team manages its own communication training without organization-wide standards.
    • Technology-only solution: Rely solely on software platforms (ex: Microsoft Teams) without addressing any issues.
    • External consultants: Hire communication specialists to facilitate workshops and coach leadership.

**Outcomes (O - What will success look like?)**
Quantitative:
    • Hoping for 10% reduction in project delays or errors caused by miscommunication (tracked via project management data).
    • Hoping for 15% increase in employee satisfaction scores regarding communication (measured in engagement surveys).
    • Increased cross-departmental collaboration as tracked by interdepartmental project participation.

Qualitative:
    • Employees report greater clarity and reduced frustration.
    • Leadership observes smoother coordination across departments.
    • Fewer complaints from employees and managers during meetings, conversations, etc. 


**Context (C - Where/when does this apply?)**
    • Organizational: Medium to large organizations with multiple departments and teams that depend on each other.
    • Geographic: Can apply to both in-person and hybrid/remote organizations.
    • Temporal: Immediate need to address communication challenges, it will take 6-12 months to be put in place and see results. 


**Why This Problem Matters?**

**Impact on Organization**
1. Reduced efficiency and productivity from unclear expectations.
2. Delays in project timelines and potential financial losses.
3. Risk of lower employee engagement and higher turnover if frustrations persist.
4. Unhappy coworkers causing the atmosphere to be negative.

**Stakeholder Impact**
1. Employees: Frustrated by miscommunication and wasted effort.
2. Managers: Struggle to align team priorities and ensure accountability.
3. Clients/Customers: May experience delays or inconsistent service due to poor internal coordination.

**Strategic Alignment**
1. Strong communication supports organizational goals of efficiency, innovation, and collaboration.
2. Improves employee satisfaction, aligning with retention and culture building strategies.
3. Enhances client satisfaction by ensuring smoother delivery of services.

**Evidence Questions to Explore For the Problem**
What evidence shows miscommunication is a recurring issue (ex: project delays, survey results)?
How widespread is the problem across departments?
What are the root causes: technology gaps, lack of training, cultural differences, unclear expectations?

# Stakeholder Analysis
# Identify and analyze all parties affected by your problem and solution

## Internal Stakeholders:
**Management: High Influence, Likely Supporter**
- **Interest in Problem:** Miscommunication across departments makes it harder for leadership to align strategy, meet deadlines, and hit performance 
    targets. It also increases frustration when managers have to resolve conflicts or clarify tasks repeatedly.
- **Interest in Solution:** Leadership would gain smoother operations, fewer bottlenecks, improved employee morale, and better achievement of 
    organizational goals. Stronger communication also reflects positively on leadership effectiveness.

**Employees/Staff: Medium Influence, Likely Supporter**
- **Interest in Problem:** Miscommunication across departments makes it harder for leadership to align strategy, meet deadlines, and hit performance 
    targets. It also increases frustration when managers have to resolve conflicts or clarify tasks repeatedly.
- **Interest in Solution:** Leadership would gain smoother operations, fewer bottlenecks, improved employee morale, and better achievement of 
    organizational goals. Stronger communication also reflects positively on leadership effectiveness.

## External Stakeholders
**Customers/Clients:** Medium Influence, Likely Supporter 
- **Interest in Problem:** Poor internal communication can cause delays, inconsistent information, and errors that directly affect service quality and 
  customer satisfaction. Clients may become frustrated if different departments provide conflicting answers.
- **Interest in Solution:** Customers would gain smoother, faster, and more reliable service. They would experience fewer errors, better consistency, 
   and stronger trust in the organization. Thereâ€™s little downside for them.

**Suppliers:** Medium Influence, Likely Support
- **Interest in Problem:** Miscommunication within the company can create inconsistent or unclear orders, delayed payments and onboarding, and 
  last-minute changes. This makes it harder for suppliers to plan production, manage inventory, and meet delivery deadlines.
- **Interest in Solution:** Suppliers would benefit from clearer and timelier communication about requirements, schedules, and payments. This 
  builds stronger partnerships, reduces costly errors, and improves trust. The only potential downside might be adjusting to new communication 
  platforms or processes.
